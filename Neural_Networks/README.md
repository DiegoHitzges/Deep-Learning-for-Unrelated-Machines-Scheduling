# Supervised Network

Our [Neural Network](https://github.com/Dieguinho1612/Deep-Learning-for-Unrelated-Machines-Scheduling/blob/main/Neural_Networks/Neural_Network.h5) has been created and trained supervisedly in the Notebook [Neural_Network.ipynb](https://github.com/Dieguinho1612/Deep-Learning-for-Unrelated-Machines-Scheduling/blob/main/Notebooks/Neural_Network.ipynb). Its layers, loss function and metric have been defined in the Notebook [Action_Pointer.ipynb](https://github.com/Dieguinho1612/Deep-Learning-for-Unrelated-Machines-Scheduling/blob/main/Notebooks/Action_Pointer.ipynb). It has been trained on the data sets 1-10, validated with data set 98 and tested by data set 99 from the [Data directory](https://github.com/Dieguinho1612/Deep-Learning-for-Unrelated-Machines-Scheduling/tree/main/Data).
